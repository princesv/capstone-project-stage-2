# capstone-project-stage-2

The app is the official application of team Aveon Racing. A team of students dedicated to design
and fabricate an electric off road vehicle. The app has an overview about the team in the main
activity along with links to all our social media handles like facebook, Instagram, Youtube,
Medium etc and an activity that shows a list of teammates in a list view. Clicking on a list item
directly takes you to activity in whatsapp where one can direct a message to that team member
. Further the app uses an external library to display a real time graph of the battery temperature
while the vehicle is running on the track. It helps the team to monitor the performance of the
vehicle while operating and avoid overheating. The app also implements Google maps and
shows current location of the vehicle.

## Why this Project

Our team designes and fabricates an off road vehicle and participates in an anual compatition called E-baja. Last year due to an accident we could not participate in the compatition. During the operation of the vehicle, the battery got overheated and as result it was rendered useless. In order to avoid such circumstances in future, I developed this application that plots a real time graph of battery temperature variation of the vehicle and its current location when under operation hence avoid overheating of vehicle.

## What Will I Learn?

You will learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use
Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity. You'll learn to:

* Use of third party libraries 
* Use of Firebase database
* Implementing Firebase authentication
* Use of Google maps API
* Implementing App widget
