# capstone-project-stage-2

The app is the official application of team Aveon Racing. A team of students dedicated to design and fabricate an electric off road vehicle. It has a brief description about our team along with links to all our social media handles like facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Medium etc and an activity that shows a list of team members and allows users to directly contact us. Further the app uses an external library to display a real time graph of the battery temperature while the vehicle is under operation. It helps the team to monitor the performance of the vehicle while operating and avoid overheating. The app also implements Google maps and shows live location of the vehicle.

## Why this Project

Our team designs and fabricates an off road vehicle and participates in an annual competition called E-baja. Last year due to an accident we could not participate in the competition. During the operation of the vehicle, the battery got overheated and as result it was rendered useless. In order to avoid such circumstances in future, I developed this application that plots a real time graph of battery temperature of the vehicle and its current location when under operation.

## What Will I Learn?
I will learn to:

* Use of third party libraries 
* Use of Firebase database
* Implementing Firebase authentication
* Use of Google maps API
* Implementing App widget
